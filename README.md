# logic-challenge

If you've found this repo and I am about to interview then welcome! You have found yourself a sneak preview of the logic challenge questions I like to ask. Consider yourself rewarded for doing research into your interviewer beforehand!

Your reward is getting to see the questions you're going to be asked and come prepared with an answer. All you have to do is simplify this code WITHOUT changing the logic. Just be forewarned, your first inclination may not be the right approach. I'd advise you dry-run with different data types passed in for the various variables being used to check your logic. Good luck!

If you're not about to be interviewed by me and have still found yourself here then feel free to lift these questions for your own logic challenges. You don't know the correct answer to these so these question might not be useful but you can use them to inform your own challenges!

Cheers
